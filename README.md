CS 570 Summer 2018, Assignment #3 Programmable Event and Timer Control Program


README FILE


File Manifest

- README.txt: This is the current text file being read which will provide instructions
	      for the program.

- makefile:   This makefile is the one that will run and link our code creating an 
	      executable file.

- a3.h: Contains all the function prototypes and includes needed for the program to run.

- a3.cpp: This is the main file for the whole project. This will allow us to run the Programmable Event and Timer Control Program.

Compile Instructions

- We included, inside of the 'makefile', the 'gcc' command that will compile the 
  source code found inside the already mentioned 'makefile'.

Operating Instructions

- First, we need to execute the 'makefile' with the 'make' command. Then, after the
  executable is created, we need to run this executable and pass one argument. 
  
Design Decisions

- We decided to include two functions plus the main function to better optimize the project
 
 Work organization
 
- Alfonso Herrera: Created the makefile and README file. Worked on getting the pthreads
  working as well as error checking.


- Pierre Kharat: Created the functions and was in charge of getting the date and time displayed
  to the screen.
